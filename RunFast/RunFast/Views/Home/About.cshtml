                                    There is an exception with triple “A”s which are considered as a bomb rather than a triplet since there are only three “A”s in a game.

                                </p>

                                    Pair straight is a deal very similar to a straight except that it is made up of three or more pairs which have the consecutive number of pips.

                                    "2" does not join any straight and "A" can only follow "K" in a straight, so the longest straight can be “3, …, J, Q, K, A” with total 12 cards.
